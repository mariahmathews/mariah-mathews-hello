# Welcome to Mariah Mathews' Public Repo :fire::fire::fire:

If you don't know, my name is Mariah Mathews.:smiley::wave:

## My Background
I majored in Computer and Information Technology at Purdue Unviersity. My degree program was created to allow students to learn core IT skills (troubleshooting, technical documentation, programming, system adminstration, networking, etc.) along with management prinicples. 

This means I started off learning higher level principles for programming that focused on convience. I say convience and not automation, as most of our projects resulted in a rough application that still required user interaction and heavy maintence. 

I learned and did some minor projects in C, C#, and Python. Most of my coding knowledge base was learned using C# to create windows based applications. I did create some simular but simpler Linux applications using C. For Python the majority of my applicable experience is split between two projects that primarily focused on using APIs for data pulling.

I also learned Google AppScript, but let's not jump into that hell pit.....:laughing:

I also did quite a bit with SQL including creating a moderately complex database from scratch.
